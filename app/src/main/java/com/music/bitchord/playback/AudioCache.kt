/**
 * On-disk cache of the audio itself, and the read-ahead that fills it.
 *
 * Two problems, one cache:
 *
 *  - **Seeking.** Everything played is written to disk on the way through, so
 *    seeking back is always a file read. Seeking *forward* past what the
 *    player has buffered is the gap, and it closes once a track is on disk in
 *    full — which is why read-ahead fetches whole tracks rather than openings.
 *  - **Track changes.** The next track needs a stream URL resolved (an
 *    Innertube round trip, plus running YouTube's player JavaScript to
 *    de-obfuscate the `n` parameter) before its first byte can even be asked
 *    for. Fetching its opening ahead of time moves all of that off the gap
 *    between songs.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by videoId, not by URL: googlevideo URLs are single-use,
 * expire within hours, and differ between resolves of the same track, so
 * keying on them would cache every track afresh on every play. Because
 * [CacheDataSource] sits *outside* the resolving data source it sees the
 * original `bitchord://watch?v=<id>` request, and a cache hit never resolves a
 * URL at all.
